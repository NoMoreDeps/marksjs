#### Marks features
Marks is a markup language that aims to keep :anguished: is __gre_at__ with Markdown, but with :mask: 
simple addition that allows it to be extended in a very :lower_left_ballpoint_pen: simpler way.

Test Xss : <h1>lkjkj</h1>

Test2 : @@xss@@

Test 3: [Xss](javascript: return true; onerror="")

[table format:csv]{{
  a,b
  <h2>dd</h2>,ss
}}

|ss|dd|
|---|:---:|
|asdd| :alien: <h1>dd </h1>|

To be clear, Marks allow custom block definition with a universal declaration syntax, and adds the ability to use options with any line.

**_This page itself is rendered on the fly by the `Marks` rendering engine, after fetching the md file representing this page_**.
____ ::- variant:dashed

##### Feature comparaison

Here you will find a feature comparaison between Marks and Markdown, and then what makes **Marks** a better solution for static page rendering.

``` ::- ref:RMD
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```

``` ::- ref:RMK
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```

[marks ref:RRO]{{
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
}}
____ ::- variant:dashed

##### Heading

To create a heading, add number signs `#` in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level, from 1 to 6

[table format:csv separator:; variant:bordered,headDark nested] {{
Markdown;Marks;Output
@@RMD@@ ; @@RMK@@ ; @@RRO@@
}}

``` ::- ref:RMD
Not supported
```

``` ::- ref:RMD2
Heading level 1
===============
Heading level 2
---------------
```

``` ::- ref:RMK
Heading 4

```

[marks ref:RRO]{{
Heading 4
====
Heading 5
=====
Heading 6

}}

[marks ref:RRO]{{

}}

##### Heading Alternate Syntax

Alternatively, on the line below the text, add any number of = from 1 to 6

[table format:csv separator:; variant:bordered,headDark nested] {{
Markdown;Marks;Output
@@RMD@@ ; @@RMK@@ ; @@RRO@@
@@RMD2@@ ; Not supported ; ---
}}

*Marks* keeps the same syntax as *Markdown* whenever ::- classes:bd-callout,bd-callout-info elt:div
it is possible. But you will see that you can do `more` than that.

``` ::- ref:RMD
I really like using Markdown.

I think I'll use it to format
all of my documents from now on.
```

``` ::- ref:RMK
I really like using Markdown.

I think I'll use it to format
all of my documents from now on.
```

[marks ref:RRO]{{
I really like using Markdown.

I think I'll use it to format 
all of my documents from now on.
}}

##### Paragraph

To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.

[table format:csv separator:; variant:bordered,headDark nested] {{
Markdown;Marks;Output
@@RMD@@ ; @@RMK@@ ; @@RRO@@
}}

``` ::- ref:RMD
This is the first line.  
And this is the second line.
```

``` ::- ref:RMK
This is the first line.  
And this is the second line.
```

[marks ref:RRO]{{
This is the first line.   
And this is the second line.
}}

##### Line Breaks

To create a line break (\<br\>), end a line with two or more spaces, and then a line feed.

[table format:csv separator:; variant:bordered,headDark nested] {{
Markdown;Marks;Output
@@RMD@@ ; @@RMK@@ ; @@RRO@@
}}

##### Emphasis

You can provide some `Emphasis` to part of the text as describe in the following table.

[table format:csv foseparator:; variant:bordered,headDark separator:| emp] {{
type|Markdown|Marks|Output
`Italic`|\*Word\*|\*Word\*|*Word*
`Italic`|\_Word\_|\_Word\_|_Word_
`Bold`|\*\*Word\*\*|\*\*Word\*\*|**Word**
`Bold`|\_\_Word\_\_|\_\_Word\_\_|__Word__
`Strikethrough`|\~\~Word\~\~|\~\~Word\~\~|~~Word~~
`Underline`|---|\~Word\~|~Word~
`Combine`|\_\_\*Word\*\_\_|\_\_\*Word\*\_\_|__*Word*__
}}

When you escape a character , ::- classes:bd-callout,bd-callout-danger elt:div
it will be replace by the HTML equivalent.  
It means for example that `\\*` will be rendered as `\&#42;`.  
   
Be aware that using it in a csv table whose separator is a `;` will have side effect.

##### Blockquote

To create a blockquote, add a `>` in front of each line that are included in the blockquote.

- [x] Markdown ::- noBullet
- [x] Marks

```md
> This is a simple `Blockquote`
```

> This is a simple `Blockquote`

```md
> This is a *Multiline* Blockquote
> With nested syntax **support**
> And it is so cool `:-)`
```

> This is a *Multiline* Blockquote  
> With nested syntax **support**  
> And it is so cool `:-)`

____ ::- variant:dashed
##### Nested Blockquote

Blockquotes can be nested. Add a `>>` in front of the line you want to nest.

- [x] Markdown ::- noBullet
- [x] Marks

```md
> This is a simple `Blockquote`
>> With nested *one*
```

> This is a simple `Blockquote`
>> With nested *one*

____ ::- variant:dashed

##### Blockquotes with Other Elements
Since the `BlockQuote` element use a dedicated renderer, there is no limitation to directly add Marks's elements

- [x] Markdown ::- noBullet
- [x] Marks

```md
> #### The quarterly results look great!
>
> * Revenue was off the chart.
> * Profits were higher than ever.
>
>  *Everything* is going according to **plan**.
```

> #### The quarterly results look great!
>
> * Revenue was off the chart.
> * Profits were higher than ever.
>
>  *Everything* is going according to **plan**.

____ ::- variant:dashed

##### Lists
The lists work almost the same way as in Markdown, but in a simpler way.
An unordered list can only be defined by an asterisk `*`, and an ordered list by a number followed by a period.

``` ::- ref:RMK
* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3
```

[marks ref:RRO]{{
* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3
}}

``` ::- ref:RMK2
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2.1
    * Item 2.1.1
  * Item 2.2
* Item 3
```

[marks ref:RRO2]{{
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2.1
    * Item 2.1.1
  * Item 2.2
* Item 3
}}

```


> A blockquote would look great below the second list item. ::- ref:RMK


 ::- classes:bd-callout,bd-callout-danger elt:div nested
**Marks** does not render `nested` list items with a recursive rendering for performance reasons. So it is not possible 
to directly embed advanced element in an `Item`.  
   
You can still nest elements by using the **Marks**`s corresponding option.  
So in markdown you can do this :  
   @@RMD@@   
In **Marks** you need to do that instead :  
  @@RMK2@@

*   This is the first list item. ::- nested
*   Here's the second list item. @@RMK@@
*   And here's the third list item.

###### Code Blocks
**Markdown** allows code block declaration by indenting with 4 spaces each line, or by defining a bloc starting and ending a line with `\`\`\`` 

 ::- classes:bd-callout,bd-callout-danger elt:div
 **Marks** is only compatible with the explicit block definition `\`\`\``.

So to define a bloc just do the following :
```
This is a bloc of code
```

You can add the language name in order to have some color syntax on the block  
`\`\`\`javascript`
```javascript
class Hello {
  sayHello() {
    return "Hello Kitty";
  }
}
```

`\`\`\`css`
```css
.cat {
  background-color #000000;
}
```
____ ::- variant:dashed

###### Images
You can insert images with the followinf syntax :
```
![Alt](Uri "Title")

```

![allo](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ogw/ADGmqu-044H6d-MJZedy-JTdyjnimsYJbqe38bUl5R1S=s48-c-mo "Title")

____ ::- variant:dashed

###### Code
To denote a word or phrase as code, enclose it in backticks '**`\``**'.
```md
Marks `Roxxxxx` !!
```
~Will output : ~  
Marks `Roxxxxx` !!

 ::- classes:bd-callout,bd-callout-danger elt:div nested
**Markdown** allows escaping the `backtick` by doubling it. **Marks** does not support this syntax. Instead, you can escape it with `\\` char.
```md
You can `escape it like that \` !`
```
You can `escape it like that \` !`

____ ::- variant:dashed


###### Horizontal Rules
To create a horizontal rule, use three or more underscores (___) on a line, wihtout any other character.

 ::- classes:bd-callout,bd-callout-danger elt:div nested
**Marks** does not allows `**\*\*\***` and `**---**` annotation style, to avoid having too many ways to do a simple declaration.

```md
___
```
___

###### Links
To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses.

```md
What is the best search engine ? [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com).
```

#### Marks options system

Now that is where funny things will begin.  
**Marks** is able to let you specify some options per kind of block of text / components. Options can be extended per plugin, per theme.
We have 2 ways to set options in **Marks**.

The first way to set options is to add a specific separator at the end of the first line of a block. You need to add \``**::\- **`\`, so 4 characters : : - and a space.

Options will differ per themes / plugins, but 3 shared params exists to style components.

[table format:csv foseparator:; variant:small,bordered,headDark emp] {{
OptionName;OptionType;Effect
**theme**;`string`;*Used to apply a specific theme to a component*
}}

This is the default rendering of the table with Bootstrap theme
``` ::- ref:RMK
| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |

##### The `ref` and the `nested`

If you want to nest something that cannot be in standard markdown, **Marks** let you use 2 great options.  
**`ref`** option will keep the component as a reference and will not render it.  
**`nested`** option will enable the possibility to replace placeholder **`ref`** with the real referenced component

For example, let`s show how to nest 2 tables declared with the **Markdown** syntax.

```
| Rows id       | A1            | A2    | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Row 1         | AA-AA         | AA-AA |
```

```
| Rows id       | B1            | B2    | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Row 1         | BB-BB         | BB-BB |
```

We want to nest the first one into the middle column of the last row of the second table. To do the magic, just put a ref on the first one, and nest it in the other.

```
| Rows id       | A1            | A2    | ::- ref:TAB_1
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Row 1         | AA-AA         | AA-AA |
```

```
| Rows id       | B1            | B2    | ::- nested
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Row 1         | @@TAB_1@@     | BB-BB |
```

~**_Et voilà_**~ (We added some variant style just to help visualize the result)

| Rows id       | A1            | A2    | ::- ref:TAB_1 variant:small,bordered theme:dark
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|

#### Marks component / plugin system

Here we go !!! **Marks**`s real power is in the way we extend the renderer. We love **Markdown** but we are always frustrated to see that stylizing even a little is painfull in **Marddown** and the way we have to use components is tricky and limited.

So **Marks** provides a **UNIQUE** component interface, so it is very easy to use and unlimited in possibility.  
To use a component, just add it with `this` syntax : 

```
[NAME OPTIONS] {{
  BODY
}}
```

And that's all. You can extends **Marks** the way you want, the way you need.

The following sample shows how to use the mermaid extention with **Marks**

```
[mermaid theme:forest] {{
sequenceDiagram
  par Alice to Bob
    Alice->>Bob: Go help John
  and Alice to John
    Alice->>John: I want this done today
    par John to Charlie
      John->>Charlie: Can we do this today?
    and John to Diana
      John->>Diana: Can you help us today?
    end
  end
}}
```

[mermaid theme:forest] {{

  par Alice to Bob
    Alice->>Bob: Go help John
  and Alice to John

    and John to Diana
      John->>Diana: Can you help us today?

  end
